## Project Overview

This repository contains two primary projects developed for **British Airways**:

1. **Ticket Purchasing Prediction Model**: A machine learning model designed to predict whether a customer would purchase a ticket based on historical data and customer behavior patterns.
2. **Customer Sentiment Analysis**: Web-scraped customer reviews analyzed to determine the overall sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) towards British Airways, providing actionable insights into customer satisfaction.

## Ticket Purchasing Prediction Model

### Dataset
- **Source**: Historical data of customer interactions with the airline's website, including session duration, pages visited, ticket prices viewed, and other behavioral metrics.
- **Preprocessing**: 
  - Handled missing values using median imputation.
  - Standardized the features using MinMaxScaler.
  - Categorical variables were converted to numerical using one-hot encoding.

### Modeling
- **Algorithms Used**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - XGBoost Classifier
- **Training and Evaluation**:
  - The dataset was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
  - Used cross-validation to optimize hyperparameters.
  - Metrics evaluated include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC (Area Under the Curve).

### Results
- **Best Performing Model**: Random Forest with an accuracy of **87%** and AUC of **0.92**.
- **Key Features**: 
  - Number of pages visited
  - Session duration
  - Time spent on payment page
